        `i have been under dipta ma’am’s counselling for about 3 years now and i feel like i have changed a lot as a person in the sense that i can manage my emotions better, i don’t feel as stressed out as i used to. being able to let out my feelings and thoughts has helped reduce a burden off my chest and i feel lighter and i find it easier to navigate through the obstacles of daily life`,
        `Miss Dipta is a remarkable therapist. She has a wonderful ability of creating a warm, safe and empathetic atmosphere which encourages me to open up and discuss my concerns without fear of judgment. She has a genuine gift for active listening, and I consistently felt heard and understood during our sessions. Her mindfulness and guidance was invaluable in enabling me to develop a better understanding of myself and my emotions. She adapted her therapeutic technique to suit my unique needs and preferences and seemed to have the right approach at the right moment which helped me achieve lasting positive change. Her level of expertise and commitment to her clients is truly impressive. Miss Dipta has helped me achieve tremendous progress in both my emotional growth and personal development. I now possess the tools to navigate life's challenges with confidence and resilience. You may trust her if you're seeking for a therapist who will make a difference and significantly improve your life.`,
        `I remember crying in the bathroom all alone around 2 years ago with no one to listen to all the things that have and still are hurting me. Though I don't think I would have shared it with any friend considering I didn't want to seem vulnerable or to confess that I was in fact depressed. I was utterly failing my subjects and wasn't emotionally stable at all. I did not know what to do in that situation or how to deal with it but what I did know was that I wanted to get better for my sake and more importantly for my future' s sake. And that is when I turned towards counseling. I remember my first session vividly, the entire setup, the room so comforting despite having the most bland display of colors. Sitting in front of the therapist, I poured out my entire heart. I cried most of the session. That session ended and due to some personal reason I couldn't continue with the same therapist. Though venting out to someone aided me in feelings emotionally lighter. A few months later, I turned towards Ms.Dipta for help. She advised me to get my blood work done, the results of which solved around 50% of the problem. I would go up to her whenever situations became too difficult to cope. Counseling helped me to learn how to regulate and cope with my emotions whenever they got out of hand. Eventually my grades improved, I started feeling much better psychologically. It's 2 years later now and I'm glad I turned to help on time. I have recovered from depression and no longer go for counseling but even now when emotions get a bit too much out of hand, I remember all the things I learnt and implement those tactics and situations become much better even if it takes time.`,
